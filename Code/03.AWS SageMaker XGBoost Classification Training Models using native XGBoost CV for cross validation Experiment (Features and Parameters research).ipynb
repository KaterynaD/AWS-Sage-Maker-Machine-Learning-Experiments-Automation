    "## AWS SageMaker XGBoost Classification Training Models using native XGBoost CV for cross validation Experiment (Features and Parameters research)\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Based on the configured list of features and/or parameters train several models to compare results. Native XGBoost CV function is used to perform cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to do a **deep**  model comparison with the same method (XGBoost Classification), target variable and dataset but different sets of features and/or parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The models can be trained in parallel and even with a large dataste, the result is available relatively soon comparing to sequntial run on a local server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is not just a model and score but also feature importance, test dataset evaluation score and training/validation errors to analyze overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSource XGBoost is used in the script and it can NOT be replaced with SageMaker built-in XGBoost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using this notebook over the previoust one (02.AWS... Training Models with cross validation) is less complex data preparation step (we do not need to create folds in advance) and less parallel running training jobs. If each training job is short one, we do not spend time to create an additional instance. There is also a limit on parallel running large instances in AWS which can be easily approach in complex experiment configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's only one way, which can be used to do Hyperparameters tuning with CV in AWS as I understand the process as for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom training script output\n",
    "\n",
    "CV output looks different from training output even if we use  standard XGBoost metrics (ROC-AUC). There is \"test\" instead of \"validation\": \n",
    "[1060]#011train-auc:0.72230+0.00097#011test-auc:0.69244+0.01114\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the script works, models trains, but to get the CV result from the script we need to implement our own proces to return results via files in S3 or any other approach you may think about. AWS SageMaker monitoring systems, charts and experiments do not recognize the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 approaches to make AWS SageMaker fully functional:\n",
    " - Adjust callback functions output in CV to make it identical to the train output. This is relatively simple option. We may even use a custom evaluation function, just name it like a standard function: accuracy, auc, etc \n",
    " - Register custom metrics with metric_defintions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/training-metrics.html#define-train-metrics-sdk).\n",
    " \n",
    "Note: there is no a mandatory need to implement one of the 2 approached if you are NOT interested in AWS SageMaker monitoring functionality. If the creation of a callback function or a custom ECR repository (see below) for custom metrics are too complex you can skip them and just use output files with CV results in S3.\n",
    " \n",
    "As on Mar/2021 open source, script mode, AWS SageMaker XGBoost is still recognized like a standard, built-in algorithm and prevent us using custom metric definitions.\n",
    "See https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-xgboost-container/issues/121\n",
    "\n",
    "The workaround is to create your own container from the official AWS Sagemaker Open Source XGBoost GitHub repository, host it in your own ECR repository, and use this image from Python SDK. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to create your own ECR repository:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install and configure aws-cli (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) or just add your user to the docker group (Some steps below do not work when docker used via sudo)\n",
    "- sudo usermod -aG docker kate\n",
    "Activate the changes to groups\n",
    "- newgrp docker\n",
    "Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo\n",
    "- docker run hello-world\n",
    "3. Build container\n",
    "- git clone https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-xgboost-container\n",
    "- docker build -t xgboost-container-base:1.2-1-cpu-py3 -f docker/1.0-1/base/Dockerfile.cpu .\n",
    "- python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal\n",
    "- docker build -t preprod-xgboost-container:1.2-1-cpu-py3 -f docker/1.2-1/final/Dockerfile.cpu .\n",
    "4. Create ECR repository and push the above image.\n",
    "- eval $(aws ecr get-login --region  us-west-2 --no-include-email | sed 's|https://||')\n",
    "- aws ecr create-repository --repository-name sagemaker-xgboost --region us-west-2\n",
    "- docker tag preprod-xgboost-container:1.2-1-cpu-py3 XYZ.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-xgboost:1.2-1-cpu-py3\n",
    "- docker push XYZ.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-xgboost:1.2-1-cpu-py3\n",
    "5. Use image_uri=XYZ.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-xgboost:1.2-1-cpu-py3 in XGBoost()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment configuration. Instead of hardcoding datafile name, target variable, featuresets and parameters sets directly in the code I use an Excel file. Each tab with a predefined name contains featuresets for each model or parameter sets, etc. At the end, the code records the results back into the same excel file. Excel is used as an UI to easily configure experiment and simplify re-use of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS SageMaker Experiment is used also but I did not find it's very useful to track the featuresets, processing and visaulaize the results (available in SageMaker notebook).  I need to average data before comparing and take into account sem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preparing training and validation datasets - data preprocessing - in S3 in a format suitable for AWS Sagemaker. SKLearnProcessor and a processing job are used to create all datasets for all models in one process but the same can be done directly in the script and only the result can be moved to S3. If the datasets can be re-used from a previous experiment, only S3 location to the files can be configured instead.\n",
    "Usually, testing different featuretests requires creation individual datasets per testing model and different parameters can be tested on the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folds are NOT created at this moment. It's done in XGBoost CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CV for each model is done in parallel. The number of simultaneously running training jobs is contolled by a parameter (MaxNumOfRunningModels).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extracting results, visualization, performing t-test and saving to an experiment log file. This is done for averaged results from all folds per model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Known issues:\n",
    "1. Warnings after upgrading SageMaker to version 2:\n",
    "INFO:sagemaker.image_uris:Defaulting to the only supported framework/algorithm version: latest.\n",
    "INFO:sagemaker.image_uris:Ignoring unnecessary instance type: None.\n",
    "Looks like warnings from XGBoost open-source estimator. No clear information about the parameters\n",
    "2. All models artifacts (debugging info) are saved into output_path provided as a parameter to the estimator (expected only model.tar.gz) except source/sourcedir.tar.gz which is saved into root of a bucket from output_path. Previously everything except model.tar.gz was saved into default bucket. This is entry_point (training) script and the path is defined in SM_MODULE_DIR environment variable but there is no clue how to change it. \n",
    "3. As on Mar/2021 open source, script mode, AWS SageMaker XGBoost is still recognized like a standard, built-in algorithm and prevent us using custom metric definitions.\n",

The script returns some additional information (feature importance, test dataset scores and train/validation errors) from training for custom processing.  The script uses a call back function to access the models and return them from the function. The models are needed for feature importance, predict and score test data. The first model is saved as model.tar.gz as in a usual training job. All models are saved in output.tar.gz with the rest of the additional data.\n",
