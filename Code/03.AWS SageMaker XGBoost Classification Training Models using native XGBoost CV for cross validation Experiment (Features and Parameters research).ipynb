    "### AWS SageMaker XGBoost Classification Training Models using native XGBoost CV for cross validation Experiment (Features and Parameters research)\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Based on the configured list of features and/or parameters train several models to compare results. Native XGBoost CV function is used to perform cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to do a **deep**  model comparison with the same method (XGBoost Classification), target variable and dataset but different sets of features and/or parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The models can be trained in parallel and even with a large dataste, the result is available relatively soon comparing to sequntial run on a local server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is not just a model and score (ROC-AUC) but also feature importance, test dataset evaluation score and training/validation errors to analyze overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSource XGBoost is used in the script and it can NOT be replaced with SageMaker built-in XGBoost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment configuration. Instead of hardcoding datafile name, target variable, featuresets and parameters sets directly in the code I use an Excel file. Each tab with a predefined name contains featuresets for each model or parameter sets, etc. At the end, the code records the results back into the same excel file. Excel is used as an UI to easily configure experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "AWS SageMaker Experiment is used also but I did not find it's very useful to track the featuresets and process and visaulaize the results (available in SageMaker notebook).  I need to average data before comparing and take into account sem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preparing training and validation datasets - data preprocessing - in S3 in a format suitable for AWS Sagemaker. SKLearnProcessor and a processing job are used to create all datasets for all models in one process but the same can be done directly in the script and only the result can be moved to S3. If the datasets can be re-used from a previous experiment, only S3 location to the files can be configured instead.\n",
    "Usually, testing different featuretests requires creation individual datasets per testing model and different parameters can be tested on the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folds are NOT created at this moment. It's done in XGBoost CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CV for each model is done in parallel. The number of simultaneously running training jobs is contolled by a parameter (MaxNumOfRunningModels).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extracting results, visualization, performing t-test and saving to an experiment log file. This is done for averaged results from all folds per model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GetFIKnown issues:\n",
    "1. Warnings after upgrading SageMaker to version 2:\n",
    "INFO:sagemaker.image_uris:Defaulting to the only supported framework/algorithm version: latest.\n",
    "INFO:sagemaker.image_uris:Ignoring unnecessary instance type: None.\n",
    "Looks like warnings from XGBoost open-source estimator. No clear information about the parameters\n",
    "2. All models artifacts (debugging info) are saved into output_path provided as a parameter to the estimator (expected only model.tar.gz) except source/sourcedir.tar.gz which is saved into root of a bucket from output_path. Previously everything except model.tar.gz was saved into default bucket. This is entry_point (training) script and the path is defined in SM_MODULE_DIR environment variable but there is no clue how to change it. "

XGBoost CV does not return best models in out of the box configuration. The script uses a call back function to access the models and return them rfom the function. the models are needed for feature importance, predict and score test data. The first model is saved as model.tar.gz as in a usual training job. All models are saved in output.tar.gz with the rest of teh additional data."
